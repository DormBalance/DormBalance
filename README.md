# FairShare

**A full-stack shared expense tracking platform for college roommates.**

FairShare eliminates the awkward "who owes who" conversation by giving households a single, transparent place to log expenses, split bills, and record settle-up payments. No more Excel sheets. No more Venmo screenshot debates.

> 🚧 Active development — website publishing in progress. Android mobile app planned.

## Overview

FairShare is built around the concept of a **household** — a group of roommates sharing a living space. Members of a household can:

- Log one-time or recurring shared expenses
- Split bills equally, by custom amount, or by percentage
- Track real-time balances showing exactly who owes whom
- Record settle-up payments (Venmo, Zelle, cash, etc.)
- Manage household membership with invite codes and role-based permissions

The entire app is serverless — the Next.js API routes handle all backend logic and connect directly to a PostgreSQL database hosted on Supabase, deployed to Vercel.

## Features

### Authentication
- Secure registration and login via **Supabase Auth**
- JWT-based session management with Bearer token validation on every API route
- Password hashing handled by Supabase (never stored in plain text)

### Households
- Create a household or join one via a unique invite code
- Email-based invite system for adding roommates
- Users can belong to multiple households simultaneously

### Role-Based Access Control
| Role | Permissions |
|---|---|
| **Admin** | Manage members, manage categories, full expense access |
| **Member** | Add expenses, view balances, record settlements |

### Expense Tracking
- Add shared or personal expenses with name, amount, date, description, and category
- Filter and browse expense history by month or category
- Link expenses to custom household categories (rent, groceries, utilities, etc.)

### Expense Splitting
- **Equal split** — divided automatically among all members
- **Custom split** — specify exact amounts per person
- Members can opt out of individual splits
- Real-time balance recalculation on every change

### Recurring Bills
- Create recurring bill templates (rent, internet, utilities)
- Automatic expense generation on weekly or monthly schedules via `/api/recurring_expenses/run-due`
- Active/inactive toggle to pause bills without deleting them

### Balances & Settlements
- Live balance dashboard showing net amounts owed across all expenses and payments
- Record settle-up payments with payment method and date
- Full payment history stored per household for transparency

```

All API routes enforce authentication via shared middleware helpers (`lib/auth_helpers.tsx`). Any endpoint is protected in two lines:

```ts
import { requireUser, requireMember, requireAdmin } from '@/lib/auth_helpers'

// Require a logged-in user
const user = await requireUser(request)

// Require household membership
const { dbUser, member } = await requireMember(householdId, user)

// Require admin role
await requireAdmin(householdId, user)
```

## Database Schema

Eight relational tables connected through foreign keys:

```
users ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │                                                          │
  ├── household_members ──── households ──┬── expense_categories
  │         (role: Admin/Member)          ├── expenses ──── expense_splits
  │                                       ├── settlements
  │                                       └── recurring_expenses
  │
  └── (creator/payer on expenses, settlements, recurring_expenses)
```

Key constraints:
- `households.invite_code` — unique
- `users.email` — unique  
- `(user_id, household_id)` in `household_members` — unique
- `(name, household_id)` in `expense_categories` — unique
- `(expense_id, user_id)` in `expense_splits` — unique

See [`DatabaseGuide.md`](./DatabaseGuide.md) for the full schema contract.
