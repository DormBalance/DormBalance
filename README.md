# 🏠 FairShare  
*A shared expense & budgeting platform for college roommates*

---

## 📌 Overview
FairShare is a web-based application designed specifically for **college students living with roommates** who want a simple, transparent way to track shared and personal expenses.

Unlike generic budgeting apps, DormBalance focuses on **household-level expense sharing**, allowing roommates to split bills (rent, groceries, utilities), see exactly **who owes who**, and record settle-up payments—all in one place.

The system supports multiple households, role-based access, recurring bills, and a central database that updates dynamically as users interact with the app.
